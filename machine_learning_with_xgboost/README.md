Usage: "python learn.py [malware_folder_path benign_folder_path [ns [num_of_files]]], where: 
* malware_folder_path & benign_folder_path are optional arguments that specify the path to the folders holding the malware / benign files (.asm or .dlldisassemble) [default: malware / benign are "/media/user/New Volume/train" and "/media/user/New Volume/benign"]
* ns is the different sized ngrams that will be used to classify files ("234" will mean the program will extract 2grams, 3grams and 4grams from each file) [default: "4"]
* num_of_files is how many files to use from each class [default: 100]

Note that the malware files can be in different folders

## Calssifying .dll Files
You can use disassembly_script.py to disassemble all .dll files in a certain folder to our own serialization, .dlldisassemble.
Usage: "python disassembly_script.py [path]" where path is the path to the folder containing the .dll files.
